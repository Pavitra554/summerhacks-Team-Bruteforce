# About:
This is a basic portfolio template which we have designed for hackathon "Summer Hacks'21" organized by SOA Code Room. This portfolio website strictly follows the summer theme as mentioned in the website <website link here>.

# Inspiration:
Anybody can make a portfolio website of any design. We have designed this portfolio very carefully as it was instructed that we can choose only one theme out of many summer themes and each theme has 4 colours. So very carefully we have to choose our colorset so that our website will look simple and classy. This was our inspiration to design a portfolio website using a predefined colorset and this was our challenge too.

# Installation Instructions:
No specific installation instructions

# What you learned (languages and tech tools):
We have planned to make this website responsive. Initially we have tried to use "CSS Flexbox". But we have faced some issue and error in that. Later we have decided to use "CSS Grid". Really "CSS Grid" is very nice as it has made our work easier. 
During this journey we have learned both CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid. 
Also we have learned some "CSS Tricks" which we didn't knew before.
We also have learned time management. We both are beginners in this domain. We are learning and implementing our knowledge and skills. Time management is a very good practise. 

# Challenges you faced:
There are two main challenges which we have faced during these 48 hours, one is making our website responsive and another is adjusting the website layout using "CSS Flexbox". Due to lack of experience of using flexbox, our website layout was somehow disfigured. As we are beginners, everything was taking time as we are learning and developing simultaneously. At the end we are running out of time. Then we have decided to replace Flexbox with Grid, which was like a saviour for us in that time.
Accomplishments you are proud of:
Time managements, CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid, using Github tools specifically Github pages.

# Future improvements:
We have to add backend and more animations in this website.
